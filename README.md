# Aditi Avilasha – Data Analyst Portfolio

## About Me
I am an MCA graduate with a strong foundation in SQL-based data analysis, online research, and data quality evaluation. I enjoy working with real-world, imperfect datasets and focus on accuracy, consistency, and meaningful insights. My approach to data analysis is methodical and detail-oriented, with an emphasis on following guidelines, validating results, and maintaining high-quality output.

I am comfortable working independently on long-term, task-based projects and adapting quickly to new tools, datasets, and evaluation frameworks. I am currently seeking entry-level opportunities in data analysis, data quality, or analytics-focused roles.
